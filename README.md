# # 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Our Task

Our task was to create a Password Generator by modifying the starter code we had been given. We had to ensure that the random password generator offered the user certain criteria so they could narrow down there password with either special characters, numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters. As seen in the image below, we just needed to make the random password generate.

As seen below as per the acceptance criteria, the user needed to choose a value between 8-128 characters, if they didnt they were shown a please try again prompt

![Invalid Input](https://github.com/Mattdsena/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/Images/invalid-outside-values.jpg)

We next had to offer the user the options to include either special characters, numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters. After each selection the user will get a prompt, clicking OK allows the user to include that value where as cancel wouldn't include that value, see below all my different prompts

![Uppercase](https://github.com/Mattdsena/PasswordGenerator/blob/main/Images/uppercase-prompt.jpg)

The user has successfully created and random password as per the screenshot below and it matches all there criteria they selected.

The user has been unsuccessful in creating a password as they didn't select any criteria, as seen in screenshot below

Overall I found this homework quite difficult and I was constantly doing additional research and rewatching the zoom meetings over and over to try and work out where I was going wrong. I am happy with the finished product but I think I need to spend more time on it and allow myself to understand it a lot more.
