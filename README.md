# # 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Our Task

Our task was to create a Password Generator by modifying the starter code we had been given. We had to ensure that the random password generator offered the user certain criteria so they could narrow down there password with either special characters, numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters. As seen in the image below, we just needed to make the random password generate.
